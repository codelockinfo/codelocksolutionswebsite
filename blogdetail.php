                            Shopify support is very important for anyone running an online
                            store on the platform. When you have problems or questions,
                            Shopify customer support is there to help you. For instance, if
                            your store isn’t functioning properly, support can help you fix
                            it quickly to avoid losing sales. You can also get assistance
                            from the support team once your store has been set up and
                            running correctly.
